# AstrologyCatalog
Along time ago, our ancestors knew that the constellations that ruled the sky the day you were born, pre-determined who you were going
to be. Do you believe if that is true or not? Search through this astrology catalog, to see who the stars say you are. 

What should this program do?
This program will allow users to pull up any of the 12 zodiac signs and become knowledgeable on all aspects of how the signs interact in
life, love and work. 


Temporary comments: 
I have the books database connected, but I tried adjusting it with Joshua Zamora to fit my program and it did not run. So after many trials
and tribulations, I just want to show you that I was able to connect a database. As well as have something submitted by midnight. I will
do more research to have my own database working and a gui for the final project.
